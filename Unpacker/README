Unpacker for hld files from TDC board
Author: Wojciech Krzemien <wojciech.krzemien@if.uj.edu.pl> 13.10.06

General notes:
************** 
Application based on Hydra classes.
You need to have Root installed.
Unpacker was tested with Root v 4.04
One can use documentation.C macro to generate html class description. Macro willcreate htmldoc directory with .pdf and .html files.

Description:
************
Hit means signal in  particular channel in particular TDC multiplicity included
(there could be up to 4 signals in particular channel per one event).


Header files:
***********
hit_wk.h
event_wk.h
eventhdr_wk.h
hldevent_wk.h
hldsubevent_wk.h
unpacker_wk.h
wkLinkDef.h 

Source files
**************

TODO:
*****
1.Check tree parameters
2.Add LinkDef.h to Makefile dependencies
3.Remove unused code
4.Documentation?
5.Add LD_LIBRARY_PATH setting in Makefile
6.Change fiber, time and width filling done (test it!)
7.Remove warnings
8.Check errors_per_event  done
9.Add space removing from unpacker constructor -->  (" sdhfs.hld");

Additional notes:
*****************
When I use rootcint to create dictionary of classes (in Makefile), I need to use -p option to call the external preprocessor. Cint does not interpret correctly the :#include <sys/types.h> and #include <sys/stat.h> (in hldevent class) which is system-dependent library.
i Disabled all functions related to Int_t RunNr variable. This variable is somehow corrupted (in file?), and I cannot stream it correctly. Mayby a sign is not interpreted correctly?
  In functions fill_lead() and fill_trail I check if for given channel the multiplicity of trailing(leading) edges is not higher than multiplicity of leading(trailing) edges +1. It means that I don't accept two or more trailing (leading) edges without leading(trailing) edge.
The order in which data is sent from TDC (leading edge or trailing edge first) is not important.

  If one has to change the number of channnels or multiplicity it should be done in hldevent_wk.h file. There are two const: kMaxMult and kMaxChannelNr. 

When one wants to use Macro for tree analysis generated with MakeClass, then  every array (in Macro Loop)) must be cleared in every iteration (I don't know why it is not done automatically, it's even written in Root manual).

CHANGES:
01.19.05 added stringstream in Unpacker
